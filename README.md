## What is it?

This application is a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals with multiple-choice questions.

## Who is it for?

Everyone! Especially students of code, coding enthusiasts, and those looking to brush up on their coding basics.

## How does it work?
* The user clicks the start button to begin the quiz.
* The user then has 50 seconds to answer 5 multiple choice questions.
* If the user chooses the wrong answer, a 10 second penalty is applied to the quiz timer and the user is asked to try answering the question again.
* If the user continues to choose the wrong answer, 10 seconds will be removed from the timer with each wrong answer.
* Once the user chooses the correct answer, they will move on to the next question.
* When the quiz is over (i.e. the timer reaches zero or the user answers all questions), the user is able to save they score along with their initials to the high score board.
